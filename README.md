 OSCP: One-Step Control Purification - Ultra-Fast Adversarial Defense
 
FIT5230 Milestone 3 Final Project - Light Team [Poker King]

This repository contains the final code, presentation materials, and documentation for the One-Step Control Purification (OSCP) system, an adversarial defense mechanism designed to break the long-standing speed bottleneck in diffusion-based defenses.

Team Members: Lu Rongqing, Yuan Cong

 Core Project Achievements

Our OSCP system achieves an industry-leading balance between speed and robustness, making real-time adversarial defense feasible.

Metric

Traditional Baseline ($\approx 500\text{ms}$)

OSCP Optimized Final Result

Improvement

Purification Speed (Single Step)

$\approx 500\text{ms}$

4.46 milliseconds

$\mathbf{100\times}$ Faster

Robustness (against PIAA)

$37.5\%$

$46.9\%$

$\mathbf{+25\%}$ Relative Gain

Key Innovations:

U-Net Capacity Enhancement ($\mathbf{hidden\_dim=128}$): Increased model size to effectively neutralize complex, evasive PIAA noise.

Adaptive Noise Control ($\mathbf{1.3\times}$): Empirically optimized signal amplification for potent single-step purification.
